# AAS191A Group 4: Solidarity Encampments and Liberation Zones

## What social problem is being addressed?
Our project aims to cement into public memory the creation, sustenance, and brutalization of and onto the 
Palestinian cause that took shape in encampments and liberated zones across campuses in the Los Angeles 
Area/globally. We want to combat the repression onto protesters from university administration, mainstream media, and the state.

## Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
We hope to hold space for the voices of those directly involved and consolidate the thoughts and feelings of the Pro-Palestine movement outside the algorithms and ocean of social media.

## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
Technical problems:
- visualizing the timelime of the building and sweeping of encampments across campuses based on user stories
- visualizing multiple encampments on one campus
- filtering trolls/sensitive information

Ethical problems:
- trying to get accurate and complete information from those directly involved but still respecting safety from self-incrimination
-  how to filter "trolls" as anything pro-Palestine tend to garner attention of zionists while trying not to push our own opinions
