# AAS191A Group 4 - Community on Campus: Palestinian Solidarity at UCLA

## What social problem is being addressed?
On October 7th, the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians became front page news and the focus of people worldwide since the armed uprising against Israel by Hamas. Israel’s and the western empire’s response to commit a horrific escalation of genocide led to public outcry and a call to action in solidarity with Palestine worldwide. Students across college campuses were (and still are) at the forefront of advocating for Palestine and supporting the resistance which eventually led to the building of encampments, liberated zones, and communes. These students and community members have faced a media war, academic and political repression, and semblances of actual war with brutalization of protesters by police. Specifically at UCLA, students, faculty, and community members have faced academic and political repression by universities and the Los Angeles city government. At UCLA, administration chose to deploy campus police and security, LAPD, LASD, and CHP onto protestors and have put in place a range of disciplinary actions from student and faculty conduct processes to hold on diplomas. In the face of legal proceedings, disciplinary hearings, and the general exploitative nature of media coverage, students have been abstaining from speaking on their experiences with solidarity encampments outside of collective fronts publicly.

## Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
Our project aims to cement into public memory the creation, sustenance, and brutalization of and onto the 
Palestinian cause that took shape in encampments and liberated zones at UCLA. We want to provide a space for the direct voices of the people be heard that have faced academic and political repression and their own unique and personal struggles.
We hope to hold space for the voices of those directly involved and consolidate the thoughts and feelings of the Pro-Palestine movement outside the algorithms and ocean of social media.

## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
Technical problems:
- visualizing the timelime of the building and sweeping of encampments across campuses based on user stories
- visualizing multiple encampments on one campus
- filtering trolls/sensitive information

Ethical problems:
- trying to get accurate and complete information from those directly involved but still respecting safety from self-incrimination
-  how to filter "trolls" as anything pro-Palestine tend to garner attention of zionists while trying not to push our own opinions
- misrepresenting the ommunity with our own biases

## About Our Mapplication
Our mapplication is a web-based tool to collect and visualize user-submitted experiences related to the Pro-Palestine movement at UCLA. Data is submitted through an online Google Form embedded in the mapplication and provides detailed (and secure) information about their involvement and experience. Using MapLibre, we visualize these submissions on an interactive map which allows visitors to see the geographic distribution of activities and significant locations related to the Pro-Palestine movement. The data is frequently updated to reflect changes and updates and provides an accurately evolving view of the movement's impact.

## Community Uses
By visualizing the Pro-Palestine movement, activists and organizations can identify patterns and locations that hold significance. This can help better plan and coordinate future actions. Additionally, this tool provides valuable data that can be studied to better understand the impact of social and political issues on universities.
