## AAS191A Group 4: Solidarity Encampments and Liberation Zones

Our project aims to cement into public memory the creation, sustenance, and brutalization of and onto the 
Palestinian cause that took shape in encampments and liberated zones across campuses in the Los Angeles 
Area/globally. As students and community members continue to be repressed by administration, mainstream media, 
and the state, we hope to create the space for the voices of those involved that continue to fight for a free 
Palestine. Due to the repression however, a main concern in the collection of user stories is the legal aspect due 
to arrests and other legal actions. A technical concern we hold is the ability to visually constitute a timeline 
of the building and sweeping of encampments.
